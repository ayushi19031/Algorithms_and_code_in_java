# Algorithms In Java
I have written all these algorithms, and their correctness is verified by the domjudge of my college (IIIT- Delhi) portal (Foobar) and most of them are submitted in java, else in python. Also, the names of the codes are self explanatory and in cases, where this is not true, a pdf is attached with ame name as code, explaining what the code wants to implement.

# LIST OF ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED

 - BRUTE FORCE APPROACH  
 - RECURSION with special emphasis on backtracking and grids  
 - BINARY SEARCH in arrays
 - SINGLY LINKED LISTS
 - DOUBLY LINKED LISTS
 - CIRCULAR LINKED LISTS
 - STACKS - USING SINGLY LINKED LISTS AND ARRAYS
 - QUEUES - USING SINGLY LINKED LISTS
 - BINARY TREES AND BINARY SEARCH TREES
 - AVL TREES
 - GRAPHS: BFS- shortest distance, bipartite, traversal of bfs tree

# BASIC CONCEPTS USED 

 - Types of data in java and their range
 - Classes and objects in java
 - Collections in java
# HOW IS THE PROGRAM RUN  
It can be run using any java ide. For example, it can be run on eclipse ide for java.


# FURTHER INITIATIVES:
To expand the number of algorithms implemented and make them freely accessible on github with simple search. Because the algorithms are written by college students and not so experienced programmers,the code uses basic concepts and if correctness is ensured, it can be useful to newbies and people needing an easy to understand reference.
